	<h1> üì∫ Humans Need Not Apply üíª</h1>
	<h2> üíø Summary üìÄ</h2>
	<h3> By: Leah De Oliveira</h3>
	<p> In the video, "Humans Need Not Apply" the narrator talks about what it would be like to co-exist with robots. Overtime, technology has been becoming more advanced and making things more efficient for humans. For example, growing up I used to need a flash drive to save my work in school or hand write essays. But now, everything I do in school is saved on a word document and shared with my teacher. This makes things easier for me because I don't have to worry about my computer crashing down since google docs saves things automatically. In the video it explains how in the future robots can be a threat to certain jobs. For instance, baristas are in danger of losing their jobs because there are already some robots that know how to make coffee and they cost a lot less. I agree and think that a lot of jobs will be taken over by robots in the future because it is more efficient and less expensive.</p>

	<h1> üéû Blown to Bits üé•</h1>
	<h2> Smile While We Snap! üì∏</h2>
	<p> In the section "Smile While We Snap!" it talks about how cameras and other forms of technology help make jobs easier, specifically jobs involving the law. For example, if someone is a victim of a crime and takes a picture of them, it makes their job so much easier. They won't have to take the time to draw out the person, they'll have a picture of what they look like exactly and it'll make them easier to find. I think that technology  </p>

	<h2>Knowing Where You Are üöó </h2>
	<p> GPS and computers is another way that people can be tracked and identified. For unstance, if someone steals a car, it can be tracked easily by GPS. GPS is connected to the satelitte so it can locate you anywhere on Earth. This is very significant update in our technology because it helps finding people easier. If someone is lost, they can use GPS to help guide them to where they need to go. </p>

	<h2> Black Boxes Are Not Just for Airplanes Anymore ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
	<p> In this blog post, it explains how technology help track the factors that are involved in an accident. For example, if one car was speeding, they would be able to determne how fast they were going before the impact. This is useful in regards to figuring out who is in the wrong in a certain situation. </p>

	<p> Leah: How old were you when you got your first computer?</p>
	<p>Sarah: I think I was 16.</p>
	<p>Leah: What was your favorite piece of technology when you were growing up?</p>
	<p>Sarah: Ummm my clock radio or CD player. I secretly liked my clock radio more because that's where I heard new music.</p>
	<p>Leah: How has technology changed over your lifetime?</p>
	<p>Sarah: Well in 1995 Bill Gates invented Windows 95, and then people started using the internet after around that time. It was all pretty fast. But the internet was slow and it sucked at first. There was no Google if you didn't know the address, you couldn't search. There wasn't Google til like 99. I used to think they should have a yellow pages for websites and then they made Google. I think technology has advanced in more ways than we even know about.</p>
	<p>Leah: Have the changes you've seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</p>
	<p>Sarah: I don't really know but I'm leaning towards helped. People were dumber and ignorant back then. Technology has made people a lot smarter.</p>
	<p>Leah: What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?</p>
	<p>Sarah: Oh man, there's no limit to the sci-fi fantasy. They could heal bodies, mind, do all our work for us. Computers could fix our every problem. </p>
	<p>Leah: What is your greatest fear for technology in the future?</p>
	<p>Sarah: Computers deciding not to work for us anymore. Singularity because full artificial intelligence can lead to human extinction. </p>
	<p>Leah: Did you like it better when there was barely any technology or how it is today?</p>
	<p>Sarah: Sometimes I miss the way things were for some reasons but overall I like it much better today.</p>
	<p>Leah: What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about technology?</p>
	<p>Sarah: Nothing gets deleted. Be careful what you say and do on social media.</p>
